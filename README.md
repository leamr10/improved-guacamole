# Module 13 Challenge

This challenge was designed for us to create routes and models for an e-commerce database
where products, tags and categories could be added, updated, retrieved and deleted using CRUD
routes.

This can be used by running "mysql -u root -p", logging in and then sourcing the schema.sql. 
After leaving MySQL, "npm run seed" and "npm start" will need to be entered and then in
Insomnia, the routes can be tested and added to.
